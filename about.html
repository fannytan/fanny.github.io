    <p>I strive to bring people closer to their purpose using my empathy. I love to prototype, and continously refine so the meaningful remains in the most compelling way possible.</p>
    <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Master of Design at the IIT Institute of Design. I have collaborated with a design agency as well as big to small entities with activities ranging from tech, retail to non-profit to improve experiences on web, mobile and inside organizations.</p>
