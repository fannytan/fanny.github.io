                <h2 class="project-section">A NEED FOR A DIGITAL LANGUAGE ARCHIVES</h2>
                <p>Preserving languages is at stake with globalization. In fact, native languages gradually become endangered
                    as its community members increasingly speak English as a primary language. To overcome this situation,
                    the elder generations strive to instill the language into the community. However, the task remains a
                    struggle.
                </p>

                <p>The department of linguistics of the University of North Texas partnered with the IIT Institute of Design
                    to help preserve endangered languages, focusing on South Asia area. They worked on a digital archives
                    concept for the community members along with professional linguists.</p>

                <h2 class="project-section">REFRAMING THE PROBLEM AND UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <p>By going through the previous team’s research, we garnered three major insights: The project aims at tackling
                    multiple issues at once and target too many stakeholders. The first version of the concept was confusing
                    due to opaque directions and priorities. The available information for the computational linguists, archives
                    manager, and community members didn’t allow to fully understand their needs.</p>

                <p>After presenting our findings to the client, we agreed to first focus on the primary users, namely the field
                    linguists, while collecting more information about the other stakeholders’ needs.</p>

                <h2 class="project-section">Prototype</h2>

                <p>Based on our research insights, we defined common functionalities for both app and website, prioritized them
                    and created a userflow upon it. We split into two others teams to work on each platform. I created wireframes
                    for the website, focusing on platform engagement and content entry.</p>

                <p>I was additionally leading the process, creating the branding and a design visual language. I strive to ensure

                <h2 class="project-section solution">Reflection</h2>
                <p>Navigating ambiguity was a major learning. In fact, priorities still needed some consensus and schedule didn't
                    allow opportunities for stakeholder interviews to happen.</p>
