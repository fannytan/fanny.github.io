                                    <p>With globalization, preserving national idiosyncrasies is at stake. This resonates in the field of linguistics as younger generation from developing countries tend to learn English as a primary language, to the cost of their native language. This lack of practice led some languages to gradually become endangered, with the elder generation struggling to instill and ultimately preserve the language into the community.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The department of linguistics of University of North Texas partnered with the Institute of Design of Chicago to help the community members along with professional linguists preserving those endangered South Asian languages through a digital languages archives, starting with the Lamkang language.</p>
                                
                                <h2 class="projectsection" id="Solution">REFRAMING THE PROBLEM AND UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT EXPERIENCE</h2>
                                    <p>During the research phase, we went through various reports to understand the scope of the problem. Our review highlighted that the tool meant to tackle several design issues at once. The first version of the tool remained also confusing and opaque due to a lack of clarification about the priorities.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Based on the interviews, I built a journey map to get an understanding of the field linguistis experience, needs and workflow from gathering data and sharing their insights on the tool.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>In parallel, we conducted a review of existing tools, comparing them to understand the advantages and painpoints in terms of offering, usability and userflow.</p>

                                    <p>Given the amount of information available for each stakeholders (field linguists, computational linguists, community  members and archive managers) and discussion about the purpose of the tool, we decided to focus our design on the field linguists as they were the primary users. The upcoming prototype should help address the need of this type of user first and gradually tackle the need of the computational linguists, allowing also the client to reflect upon the priorities and refined the product.</p>

                                    <p>Navigating ambiguity was a major learning. In fact, priorities still needed some consensus and schedule didn't allow opportunities for stakeholder interviews to happen.</p>
