                        <h2 class="projectsection" id="problem">CREATING AN APP FOR WIX MARKETPLACE</h2>
                            <p>Arrays is a digital platform that enables anyone to easily create beautiful data visualization, and publish them online with no expertise required. In that perspective, Schema Design, the design firm behind the product, initiated a partnership with Wix, a platform that facilitate web site creation. Once available in Wix marketplace, the users would be able to use Arrays as an app to create and add their own data visualization.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="projectsection" id="challenge">BALANCING DESIGN AND BUSINESS CONSTRAINTS</h2>
                            <p>I began to do some secondary research to understand Wix. Putting myself in the users’ shoes, I got familiar with the process of adding an app, ranging from its search to its installation, and its actual use. In addition, from a design standpoint, I navigated the platform’s documentation to understand the app design and development process as well their requirements. I supplemented my insights by looking at different apps to understand how those guidelines materialized, gauging the range of possibilities. </p>
                            <p> One challenge here was to find the right balance between fitting Wix experience and design language without disconnecting from the current Arrays workflow and style. The goal was to preserve some consistency between the web and Wix version as a product. From a business and development perspective, it was also important to consider the cost in time and efforts to implement the product give other projects and current resources available.

                        <h2 class="projectsection" id="process">SIMPLIFYING THE INTERFACE</h2>
                            <p>I started my wireframes by transposing the current Arrays web experience into the Wix layout to get a first feedback from the partner about our current experience and how it could fit their guidelines. After a round of exploration, the current experience could benefit from some improved as it appears to be too advanced.</p>

                            <p>To decomplexify the interface, contextual information was added and the wording also changed to make place to less technical terms. The number of steps and screens got reduced as well. Some elements not relevant to the Wix experience were removed. Finally, interface-wise, the design language got standardized making the design language more consistent and clear.</p>

                            <p>The implementation is still in progress as the final design has not been released yet.</p>

                        <h2 class="projectsection" id="reflection">REFLECTION</h2>
                            <p>This project enlightened me about the actual implementation process of a design. I learned about the different technical and business constraints in place to bring a idea to life.</p>

                            <p>This project also gave me a good exposure to what designing an app for a platform entails, from understanding and navigating the range of possibilities to finding the right balance between the platform provider's expectations and the experience consistency cross-platforms. In addition, the exercice itself presented more opportunities to iterate on simplifying the user flow and communication to add more value for the user.</p>
