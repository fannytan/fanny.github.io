                <div class="project-section">CREATING AN APP FOR WIX MARKETPLACE</div>
                <p>Arrays is a digital platform that enables anyone to easily create beautiful data visualization, and publish
                    them online with no expertise required. In that perspective, Schema Design, the design firm behind the
                    product, initiated a partnership with Wix, a platform that facilitate web site creation. Once available
                    in Wix marketplace, the users would be able to use Arrays as an app to create and add their own data
                    visualization.
                </p>

                <div class="project-section">BALANCING DESIGN AND BUSINESS CONSTRAINTS</div>
                <p>I began to do some secondary research to understand Wix. Putting myself in the users’ shoes, I got familiar
                    with the process of adding an app, ranging from its search to its installation, and its actual use. In
                    addition, from a design standpoint, I navigated the platform’s documentation to understand the app design
                    and development process as well their requirements. I supplemented my insights by looking at different
                    apps to understand how those guidelines materialized, gauging the range of possibilities.
                </p>
                <p> One challenge here was to find the right balance between fitting Wix experience and design language without
                    disconnecting from the current Arrays workflow and style. The goal was to preserve some consistency between
                    the web and Wix version as a product. From a business and development perspective, it was also important
                    to consider the cost in time and efforts to implement the product give other projects and current resources
                    available.
                </p>

                <!-- <img class="img-fluid assets" src="assets/img/thumbnail.png" alt=""> -->
                <div class="project-section">SIMPLIFYING THE INTERFACE</div>
                <p>I started my wireframes by transposing the current Arrays web experience into the Wix layout to get a first
                    feedback from the partner about our current experience and how it could fit their guidelines. After a
                    round of exploration, the current experience could benefit from some improved as it appears to be too
                    advanced.
                </p>

                <p>To decomplexify the interface, contextual information was added and the wording also changed to make place
                    to less technical terms. The number of steps and screens got reduced as well. Some elements not relevant
                    to the Wix experience were removed. Finally, interface-wise, the design language got standardized making
                    the design language more consistent and clear.</p>

                <div class="project-section">OUTCOME</div>
                <p>The implementation is still in progress as the final design has not been released yet.</p>

                <div class="project-section">REFLECTION</div>
                <p>This project enlightened me about the actual implementation process of a design. I learned about the different
                    technical and business constraints in place to bring a idea to life.</p>
                <p>This project also gave me a good exposure to what designing an app for a platform entails, from understanding
                    and navigating the range of possibilities to finding the right balance between the platform provider's
                    expectations and the experience consistency cross-platforms. In addition, the exercice itself presented
                    more opportunities to iterate on simplifying the user flow and communication to add more value for the
                    user.
